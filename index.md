Australian-Chinese tenor *Kang Wang* is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after young lyric tenors in the opera world. He is a former member of the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program of the Metropolitan Opera and a finalist in the 2017 Cardiff Singer of the World competition.

Last season, Mr. Wang made his house and role debut at Washington National Opera as Ferrando in Così fan tutte, and his house debut at the State Opera of South Australia as Alfredo in La traviata. He also made his house debut at Seattle Opera as Rodolfo in La bohème, returned to Opera Australia in the same role, and returned to Opera Queensland as Alfredo in La traviata.
