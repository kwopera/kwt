_“Kang Wang has a herculean voice for the ages, striding through his arias with a rare ease and sheen.”_

-- The Australian

_“… a most beautiful voice that has been likened to liquid gold. It is a near-perfect instrument that is an absolute joy to listen to, matching a powerful and dramatic stage presence.”_

-- Limelight Magazine

"Kang Wang, making his company début, was a revelation as Rodolfo. It’s little wonder that this young Australian tenor, born in China to opera-singer parents, is turning heads around the world. Singing and acting with extraordinary freedom and poise, he was a most plausible poet and lover. ‘Che gelida manina’ – clearly Wang’s kind of music – revealed a thrilling tenor, with real ping at the top, but there is also a pleasing baritonal quality to this arresting voice. Opera Australia may have just found its next real thing."

-- Australian Book Reviews

"Kang Wang’s full lyric tenor suited with Requiem perfectly, bringing Verdi’s operatic style to the religious work. His Ingemisco emanated from the stage with exquisite legato and tasteful phrasing. His trio with Pancella and bass Michael Dean in the Lux aeterna wove a wonderful web of somber melancholy."

-- Eugene Scene

"Opera North debutant Kang Wang, as Tamino, impresses immediately with the contrasting fevered dread and love-struck lyricism of his opening arias, delivered with dramatic authority and musicality. As a Mozartian hero, his portrayal carries a special charge throughout." 

-- The State of Hearts UK

"Kang Wang was one of the main prize finalists in the Cardiff Singer of the World in 2017 and it’s easy to see and hear why in playing the role of Alfredo.
There is an exceptional quality in his voice and while there is clearly power and control, he exhibits a soft tenderness in many of the intimate sections. In many of the quieter passages he is capable of judging perfectly the volume needed to express his character’s emotional state against the needs of clarity for his audience.
Listening to him you feel certain that his talent and tone are very special, which, alongside his acting ability here, made for a very convincing portrayal of his character.”

-- Behind the Arras


“Young Australian-Chinese tenor Kang Wang was a finalist in the Cardiff Singer of the World last year. His range is delivered smoothly throughout, especially across the break, and there is an admirable warmth of tone in his quieter passages as the love-sick Alfredo. This is a voice which will be welcome in the world’s great opera houses for many years to come.”

-- Express and Star

"Kang Wang, another newcomer to the company, accomplished what tenors in the role of Don Ottavio rarely do – he gave the audience a believable understanding of why he was the grand Donna Anna’s fiancé. Usually the character comes across as a bit of a milksop, trailing in the formidable lady’s wake for no obvious reason, but he sang and acted the part in a manner that conveyed a strength that frequently is lost. In a spot or two his phrasing was not of the smoothest, but seeing this role in the hands of a singer who could make something of the part was such a refreshing change that it didn’t much matter."

-- onStage Pittsburgh


"The entire cast is worthy of kudos, but the leading roles are played by the best in opera today. Kang Wang who dazzled Austin audiences in LA BOHEMÈ last season returns to play the playboy Duke with his gorgeous tenor and depth of character. He takes the iconic "La donna è mobile" from frivolous to haunting in the final act."
